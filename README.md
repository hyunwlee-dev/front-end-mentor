### 🛠️ Built with

- semantic HTML5 markup
- nextJS
- redux-tool-kit
- framer-motion for animations
- tailwindcss

### 🎨 Features

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slideshow and view each painting in a lightbox

### 📜 What I learnt?

- using tailwindcss
- framer-motion
- dynamic routing in nextJS
- ssg (Even though fetch responses are slow in dev mode, the code written with ssg is clearly faster in production)

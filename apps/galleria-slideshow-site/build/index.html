He took the painting with him to Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he showed it to Dr. Paul Gachet, who thought it was \"absolutely fanatical\". Art historians are divided as to whether this painting or Self-portrait without beard is Van Gogh's final self-portrait. The art historians Ingo F. Walther and Jan Hulsker consider this to be the last.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh_self-portrait_(1889)","artist":{"image":"/assets/van-gogh-self-portrait/artist.jpg","name":"Vincent Van Gogh"},"images":{"thumbnail":"/assets/van-gogh-self-portrait/thumbnail.jpg","hero":{"small":"/assets/van-gogh-self-portrait/hero-small.jpg","large":"/assets/van-gogh-self-portrait/hero-large.jpg"},"gallery":"/assets/van-gogh-self-portrait/gallery.jpg"},"sizes":{"artist":{"width":128,"height":128},"thumbnail":{"width":600,"height":917},"hero":{"small":{"width":654,"height":560},"large":{"width":950,"height":1120}},"gallery":{"width":597,"height":712}}},{"id":"the-basket-of-apples","name":"The Basket of Apples","year":1893,"description":"The Basket of Apples (French: Le panier de pommes) is a still life oil painting by French artist Paul Cézanne, which he created c. 1893. The painting is particularly remarkable for its creative composition, which rejected realistic representation in favour of distorting objects to create multiple perspectives. This approach eventually influenced other art movements, including Fauvism and Cubism. It belongs to the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basket_of_Apples","artist":{"image":"/assets/the-basket-of-apples/artist.jpg","name":"Paul Cézanne"},"images":{"thumbnail":"/assets/the-basket-of-apples/thumbnail.jpg","hero":{"small":"/assets/the-basket-of-apples/hero-small.jpg","large":"/assets/the-basket-of-apples/hero-large.jpg"},"gallery":"/assets/the-basket-of-apples/gallery.jpg"},"sizes":{"artist":{"width":128,"height":128},"thumbnail":{"width":600,"height":789},"hero":{"small":{"width":654,"height":560},"large":{"width":950,"height":1120}},"gallery":{"width":869,"height":712}}},{"id":"the-swing","name":"The Swing","year":1767,"description":"The painting depicts an elegant young woman on a swing.

A smiling older man, who is nearly hidden in the shadows on the right, propels the swing with a pair of ropes. The older man appears to be unaware of the young man. As the young lady swings high, she throws her left leg up, allowing her dainty shoe to fly through the air.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swing_(Fragonard)","artist":{"image":"/assets/the-swing/artist.jpg","name":"Jean-Honoré Fragonard"},"images":{"thumbnail":"/assets/the-swing/thumbnail.jpg","hero":{"small":"/assets/the-swing/hero-small.jpg","large":"/assets/the-swing/hero-large.jpg"},"gallery":"/assets/the-swing/gallery.jpg"},"sizes":{"artist":{"width":128,"height":128},"thumbnail":{"width":600,"height":624},"hero":{"small":{"width":654,"height":560},"large":{"width":950,"height":1120}},"gallery":{"width":585,"height":712}}},{"id":"penitent-magdalene","name":"Penitent Magdalene","year":1625,"description":"Penitent Magdalene is a painting by the Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi.

{"pageProps":{"artData":{"name":"Van Gogh Self-portrait","year":1889,"description":"This self-portrait was one of about 32 produced over a 10-year period, and these were an important part of his work as a painter; he painted himself because he often lacked the money to pay for models. He took the painting with him to Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he showed it to Dr. Paul Gachet, who thought it was \"absolutely fanatical\". Art historians are divided as to whether this painting or Self-portrait without beard is Van Gogh's final self-portrait. The art historians Ingo F. Walther and Jan Hulsker consider this to be the last.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh_self-portrait_(1889)","artist":{"image":"/assets/van-gogh-self-portrait/artist.jpg","name":"Vincent Van Gogh"},"images":{"thumbnail":"/assets/van-gogh-self-portrait/thumbnail.jpg","hero":{"small":"/assets/van-gogh-self-portrait/hero-small.jpg","large":"/assets/van-gogh-self-portrait/hero-large.jpg"},"gallery":"/assets/van-gogh-self-portrait/gallery.jpg"},"sizes":{"artist":{"width":128,"height":128},"thumbnail":{"width":600,"height":917},"hero":{"small":{"width":654,"height":560},"large":{"width":950,"height":1120}},"gallery":{"width":597,"height":712}},"index":6}},"__N_SSG":true}

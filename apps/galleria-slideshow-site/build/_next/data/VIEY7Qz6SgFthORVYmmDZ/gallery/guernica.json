{"pageProps":{"artData":{"name":"Guernica","year":1937,"description":"The scene occurs within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a grieving woman holding a dead child in her arms. In the center of the room a horse falls in agony with a large gaping hole in its side, as if it had just been run through by a spear or javelin. The horse appears to be wearing chain mail armor, decorated with vertical tally marks arranged in rows. A dead and dismembered soldier lies under the horse. The hand of his severed right arm grasps a shattered sword, from which a flower grows.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_(Picasso)","artist":{"image":"/assets/guernica/artist.jpg","name":"Pablo Picasso"},"images":{"thumbnail":"/assets/guernica/thumbnail.jpg","hero":{"small":"/assets/guernica/hero-small.jpg","large":"/assets/guernica/hero-large.jpg"},"gallery":"/assets/guernica/gallery.jpg"},"sizes":{"artist":{"width":128,"height":128},"thumbnail":{"width":600,"height":523},"hero":{"small":{"width":654,"height":560},"large":{"width":950,"height":1120}},"gallery":{"width":1253,"height":712}},"index":2}},"__N_SSG":true}

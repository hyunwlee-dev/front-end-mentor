{"pageProps":{"artData":{"name":"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee","year":1633,"description":"The painting, in vertical format, shows a close-up view of Christ's disciples struggling frantically against the heavy storm to regain control of their fishing boat. A huge wave beats the bow and rips the sail. One of the disciples is seen vomiting over the side. Another one, looking directly out at the viewer, is a self-portrait of the artist. Only Christ, depicted on the right, remains calm.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Storm_on_the_Sea_of_Galilee","artist":{"image":"/assets/the-storm-on-the-sea-of-galilee/artist.jpg","name":"Rembrandt"},"images":{"thumbnail":"/assets/the-storm-on-the-sea-of-galilee/thumbnail.jpg","hero":{"small":"/assets/the-storm-on-the-sea-of-galilee/hero-small.jpg","large":"/assets/the-storm-on-the-sea-of-galilee/hero-large.jpg"},"gallery":"/assets/the-storm-on-the-sea-of-galilee/gallery.jpg"},"sizes":{"artist":{"width":128,"height":128},"thumbnail":{"width":600,"height":624},"hero":{"small":{"width":654,"height":560},"large":{"width":950,"height":1120}},"gallery":{"width":597,"height":712}},"index":4}},"__N_SSG":true}
